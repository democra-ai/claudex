Each profile keeps its own login, chats, settings, MCP connectors, plugins, and skills. Open multiple Claude windows at once, each on a different account. Share extensions, MCP servers, and skills across profiles selectively, through a live matrix UI.

> **Unofficial community tool.** Uses public Electron flags (`--user-data-dir`) and an undocumented-but-stable Claude Code env var (`CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`) to isolate profiles. Not endorsed by Anthropic.

## Features

- **Side-by-side profiles** — fully isolated Desktop and Code accounts. Independent auth, chats, MCP, skills.
- **Live status** — sidebar polls every 10 s; the running profile gets a pulsing dot and a `LIVE` pill.
- **One click, two apps** — New Profile creates the Desktop launcher (`Claude WORK.app`) *and* the Code CLI alias (`claude-work`) in one step.
- **Selective sharing** — extensions and skills via live symlinks (edits propagate both ways); MCP servers and preferences via atomic copy-on-apply.
- **Matrix UI** — every profile × every content item in one grid. Five-state glyphs (■●◐○·) show share status at distance.
- **Profile detail** — today's tokens, rolling 5h / 7d session counts, pace vs your own baseline, account identities, storage breakdown, sharing graph.
- **Cross-tool import** — bring a Codex session into Claude Code (or vice-versa) as a brand-new, resumable session. `convert codex claude` parses the Codex rollout and writes a fresh `~/.claude/projects/…` transcript you can `claude --resume`. Import, not sync — see [How it works](#how-it-works).
- **CLI included** — the original interactive wizard is here too: `add`, `list`, `status`, `convert`, `repair`, `remove`.

## Install

### App (recommended)

Grab the latest `.dmg` from **[Releases](https://github.com/democra-ai/claudies/releases/latest)** and drag **Claudies.app** to `/Applications`.

The build is unsigned, so first launch needs a right-click → **Open**, or:

```bash
xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine "/Applications/Claudies.app"
```

### CLI only

```bash
npm install -g github:democra-ai/claudies
```

Node 18+. The Code half works on Linux; the Desktop half is macOS-only because Claude Desktop is.

### Build from source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/democra-ai/claudies
cd claudies
npm install && npm run frontend:install
npm run tauri:dev      # GUI with hot reload
npm run tauri:build    # produces .app + .dmg
```

Requires Rust, Xcode CLT, Node 18+.

## Quick start

1. Open Claudies.
2. Sidebar bottom → **NEW PROFILE** → name it `work` → check ☑ Desktop + ☑ Code → click `+`.
3. `Claude WORK.app` lands in `~/Applications/`. Drag it to the Dock.
4. New terminal tab — the `claude-work` alias is live.
5. **Quit any other Claude window with Cmd+Q before first-launching the new profile** (the `claude://` auth deep link routes to whichever Claude is already running).

CLI equivalent: `claude-multiprofile add`.

## How it works

**Claude Desktop** is an Electron app and honors `--user-data-dir`, which relocates all app state (auth, chats, settings, MCP, projects) to a directory of your choosing. The launcher is a tiny AppleScript bundle: `open -n -a Claude --args --user-data-dir=/path/to/profile`. Different folder → different instance.

**Claude Code** honors the `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` env var. The OAuth token in macOS Keychain is keyed by a SHA-256 of that path, so swapping the env var swaps the auth entirely.

**Sharing.** Two models. Extensions and skills are *symlinked* — edits propagate live both ways. MCP servers and preferences are *copy-on-apply* — you can't symlink a JSON key, so the value is written atomically (temp + rename) at Apply time.

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/assets/share-symlink.svg" alt="Animated illustration of two profile folders; one extension subfolder in 'work' is replaced with a symlink to the same folder in 'default', showing live two-way sharing." width="720">
</p>

**Cross-tool import.** Claude Code and Codex store conversations in different on-disk formats (Claude: a `parentUuid` DAG of Anthropic-format messages under `projects/`; Codex: a linear log of OpenAI response-items under `sessions/`). They can't be losslessly synced — threading models differ and each tool's reasoning payloads are provider-private. So `convert` does the pragmatic thing: it reads the source session through a shared intermediate representation and **writes a new session in the target tool's format** (preserving text, tool calls, and tool results; dropping crypto reasoning and flattening branches). Codex→Claude is clean (Claude indexes from JSONL); Claude→Codex is best-effort (Codex also keeps a SQLite index its picker reads — for that direction, Codex 0.139.0+'s official `/import` is preferred).

## The matrix

Rows are content items, columns are the profiles you've checked. Each cell encodes share state as both a glyph and a color (legible at distance and for colorblind users):

| Glyph | State | Meaning |
|-------|-------|---------|
| ■ | Shared | Live symlink between ≥ 2 profiles — edits propagate |
| ● | Copied | One-shot copy, currently aligned |
| ◐ | Diverged | Same item, different values across profiles |
| ○ | Independent | Present here, not aligned with any other profile |
| · | Absent | Not in this profile |

## CLI reference

```bash
claude-multiprofile add            # interactive wizard (Desktop, Code, or both)
claude-multiprofile list           # configured profiles + paths
claude-multiprofile status         # health-check directories, .apps, aliases
claude-multiprofile extensions <p> # multi-select copy Desktop extensions
claude-multiprofile convert <f> <t> [s]  # import a session between claude<->codex
claude-multiprofile repair <p>     # re-register macOS launcher (icon-cache fix)
claude-multiprofile remove <p>     # tear down a profile (data kept by default)
claude-multiprofile upgrade        # pull latest from GitHub
```

Pass `--help` to any command for flags.

## Security

Reads & writes only inside the per-profile data folders, the launcher `.app` bundles in `~/Applications/`, the registry at `~/.config/claude-multiprofile/`, and a delimited managed block in `~/.zshrc`. Never touches your default Claude install, macOS Keychain, IndexedDB / cookies, or anything else on disk. CLI has one runtime dep (`@inquirer/prompts`); the Tauri app's release bundle vendors its own runtime.
